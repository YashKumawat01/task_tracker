Simple structure.
Easy to scale.
No chaos.

🧪 Future Improvements (Optional)

Only if execution demands it:

Full PWA support (offline caching)

Task history & analytics

Authentication & cloud sync

Mobile app wrapper (Capacitor / React Native)

Do not build these unless required.
Overengineering is weakness.
